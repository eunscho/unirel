Description: Compute and compare unidimensional reliability coefficients. 
    This package provides the following: coefficient alpha, unidimensional 
    confirmatory factor analysis reliability (congeneric reliability), 
    the Gilmer-Feldt coefficient, Feldt's classical congeneric reliability, 
    Hancock's H, Heise-Borhnstedt's Omega, Kaiser-Caffrey's alpha, 
    and Ten Berge and Zegers' mu series. Reliability coefficients 
    provided by other packages are also gathered and compared.
