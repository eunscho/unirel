#' A dataset to check the sensitivity of the violation of essential tau-equivalence
#'
#' A hypothetical data consisting of three items. Item 1 has a variance of 1,
#'  item 2 is a copy of item 1, and item 3 is item 1 divided by 2. This is
#'  the data presented by Cho (in press) to show that coefficient alpha is
#'  sensitive to the violation of the assumption of being essentially
#'  tau-equivalent.
