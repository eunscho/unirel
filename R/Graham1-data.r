#' Graham's (2006) first unidimensional data
#'
#' Graham's (2006) artificial dataset consisting of five items.This is the
#' second dataset in his Table 2. The last item is about five times as important
#'  as the other items. This dataset provides a good indication of how sensitive
#'  each reliability coefficient  is to the violation of the tau equivalence
#'  assumption. The CFA reliability coefficient presented by the author is .97.
#'  There are currently various approaches to FA reliability, and this value
#'  can be used to check whether these approaches refer to the same thing (Cho
#'  in press).
